# Next Steps

- better config of general models

- facilellm hot and cold presets; try them; associate with conversation?
- prompt templates
- function to fill several registers

- user story with repeated pruning/purging to keep promt empty
  - vocabulary extraction
    - first scan, then mark, then extract via AI
  - proofread EN document
    - verify the prompt for efficiency
  - Latex proofread
    - sometimes replaces shortcuts, give instrutions/example against this
  - comment and explain code
  - generate ideas, brief
  - generate ideas, extensive
  - find error in code
  - generate code

- config: don't open new windows except when asked explicitly

- pruning in visual: prune messages touched by highlight

- enable loading a session via visual mode

- shortcut for changing model in session

# Features discarded in first implementation

- annotate generating model
- autoprune, configurable per model
